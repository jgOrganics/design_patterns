# Design Patterns for Object-Oriented Programming (GoF) in Dart

Welcome to the "Design Patterns for Object-Oriented Programming in Dart" project! This repository contains a collection of classic design patterns as described by the Gang of Four (GoF) book, implemented using the Dart programming language.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems that software developers encounter during the design and implementation of software systems. The Gang of Four (GoF) book, titled "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," introduced 23 design patterns categorized into three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Patterns Implemented

This project aims to provide clear and concise implementations of the GoF design patterns in Dart. The patterns are grouped into their respective categories:

### Creational Patterns
1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

### Structural Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor

## Getting Started

To explore the various design patterns implemented in this project, simply navigate to the respective directories within the repository. Each pattern has its own directory containing the Dart code for the implementation along with relevant explanations.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/design-patterns-dart.git`
2. Navigate to the pattern of interest, e.g., `cd creational/singleton`
3. Review the Dart code and accompanying explanations to understand the pattern's implementation details.
4. Experiment with the code, modify it, and integrate it into your own projects as needed.
